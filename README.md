# Mesoscale-Oceanic-Eddy-Dataset
The file is source mesoscale oceanic eddy dataset which was established  from the SAR images generated by ENVISAT and ERS-2 Satellites between 2005 and 2011. We used the SAR images covering the area 13째N to 25째N and 116째E to 125째E where Kuroshio passes through and generates many mesoscale and sub-mesoscale eddies.  We will enrich the dataset by using SAR images from other satellites, and other sea area.
